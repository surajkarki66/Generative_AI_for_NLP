One of the key reasons why ChatGPT and GPT4 seem so ridiculously impressive is because of this second stage of training.\n",

        "#### 2c. Fine-tuning\n",
        "Doing inference with a transformer is just like training. You insert a prompt and out comes the next word. For GPT models, this means that the prompt is extended one word at a time. You insert the prompt, and outcomes the first word of the answer. The first word of answer  is now added to the prompt, creating a new slightly different prompt. This prompt is again forwarded through the model, giving the prediction of new word.\n",
